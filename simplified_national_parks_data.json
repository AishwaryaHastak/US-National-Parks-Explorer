        "weatherInfo": "Temperatures are relatively cool all year, thanks to the park and preserve's high elevation. Conditions are most often calm, but winds can arise, especially in spring and during storm fronts. Daytime temperatures feel warmer here year round due to intense high-altitude sunlight, and a scorching mid-day summer sand surface. Plan to explore the dunes morning or evening during summer. Nights are cool in summer, and frigid in winter. Visit the Great Sand Dunes website for the most accurate weather forecasts."
